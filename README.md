The India COVID-19 Report Analysis project aims to analyze and visualize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across India using Microsoft Power BI. The project involves collecting real-time data on confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, testing, and vaccination rates from reliable sources. The data is cleaned, transformed, and integrated into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard that provides clear insights into national and state-wise trends.

The dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total confirmed cases, total deaths, recovery rate, active cases, test positivity rate, and vaccination coverage. Various visualizations like line charts, bar charts, maps, and slicers are used to explore the data dynamically. Through Power BI’s DAX formulas and data modeling, users can observe patterns such as daily case fluctuations, growth rates, and vaccination progress over time.

This analysis helps in understanding the spread of the virus, identifying high-risk regions, and evaluating the effectiveness of public health measures. By providing a visual representation of complex datasets, the project simplifies data interpretation for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. Overall, this Power BI project contributes to effective data-driven decision-making and enhances awareness of India’s COVID-19 situation through interactive analytics and meaningful visualization
